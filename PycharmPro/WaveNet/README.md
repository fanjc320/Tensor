This is the code for 'How to Make a Simple Tensorflow Speech Recognizer' by @Sirajology on Youtube

Overview
============
This is the full code for 'How to Make a Simple Tensorflow Speech Recognizer' by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/u9FPqkuoEJ8).
In this demo code we build an LSTM recurrent neural network using the TFLearn high level Tensorflow-based library to train
on a labeled dataset of spoken digits. Then we test it on spoken digits. 

Dependencies
============
* tflearn (http://tflearn.org/)
* tensorflow  (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)
* future

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Usage
===========

Run the following code in terminal. This will take a couple hours to train fully.

`python demo.py`


Challenge
===========

The weekly challenge is from the last video, it's still running! Check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYU5t8MO7s)

Credits
===========
Credit for the vast majority of code here goes to [pannouse](https://github.com/pannous). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started!
